# game-dev-capstone-project

Game Development Capstone Project, College of DuPage		February to May 2019
•	Programmed using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) Blueprints as part of a group of four people working on a 3D sci fi multiplayer-focused third-person arena shooter
•	Constructed a State Machine with Blend Spaces and Aim Offsets to trigger smooth animations accurate to the game designer’s vision, using a prebuilt, rigged, and rendered player model
•	Customized a menu carousel asset to fit the UI design vision decided upon by my team
